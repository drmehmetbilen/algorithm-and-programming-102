# Algorithm and Programming 102

- Course repository for weekly lecture notes, code snippets, and class discussion stories.
- The repository is designed to grow week by week.
- Each week has its own folder so students can follow the curriculum in order.

## Goal of This Repo
- Keep all course material in one place.
- Provide short, practical examples for data structures and algorithms.
- Make weekly content easy to find and reuse.

## Repository Structure
- `week-XX/`
  - `README.md` -> lecture notes for that week
  - `story.md` -> class discussion story/context
  - `src/` -> code snippets used in lecture

## Current Weeks
- `week-01`
  - Topics: Stack, Queue, Singly Linked List

## How Students Should Use This Repo
- Start from the current week folder.
- Read `README.md` first (concepts + workflows + homework).
- Open `src/` files and review implementations line by line.
- Test code quickly in interactive mode:
  - `python3 -i week-01/src/1-stack.py`
  - `python3 -i week-01/src/2-queue.py`
  - `python3 -i week-01/src/3-linked_list.py`
- - Read `story.md` for discussion context (Optional).
