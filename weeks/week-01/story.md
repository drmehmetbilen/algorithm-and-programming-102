## Margaret Hamilton and Apollo 11 Moon Landing

- In the 1960s, Margaret Hamilton led the software engineering team for NASA's Apollo Guidance Computer at MIT Instrumentation Laboratory.
- Her team wrote mission-critical code for lunar missions, including Apollo 11.
- At that time, software was often treated as secondary, but Hamilton insisted software engineering needed discipline, testing, and rigorous design.

## Why Her Work Matters

- During Apollo 11's landing phase, the computer triggered repeated alarms (`1201` and `1202`).
- The onboard computer was overloaded, but the system did not crash.
- Hamilton's software design prioritized critical landing tasks and deferred less important ones.
- Because of that priority-based behavior, astronauts could continue and land safely on the Moon.
